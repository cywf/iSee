# Rust

## Pros

1. **Performance**: Rust is a compiled language and generally offers better performance than Python, especially for CPU-bound tasks.

2. **Memory safety**: Rust has built-in memory safety features, which can help prevent issues like data races and memory leaks.

3. **Concurrency**: Rust has better support for multi-threading and concurrency, making it more suitable for applications that require efficient parallel processing.

## Cons

1. **Steeper learning curve**: Rust has a steeper learning curve than Python, which can make development slower, especially for beginners.

2. **Smaller ecosystem**: While Rust's ecosystem is growing, it's not as extensive as Python's, so you might have fewer libraries and tools to choose from.

In the context of an OCR productivity tool, Python might be a better choice if your priority is rapid development and ease of use. Python's extensive ecosystem and cross-platform compatibility can be advantageous in this scenario.

However, if performance, memory safety, and concurrency are crucial for your application, Rust might be a more suitable choice.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your priorities, familiarity with the languages, and the specific requirements of your project.

To get started with building the Rust application, create a new Rust project named "iSee" and set up the directory structure as follows:

```lua
iSee/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── main.rs
└── .gitignore
```

1. First, create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new iSee
cd iSee
```

This will generate the basic directory structure and files for a new Rust project, including `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, and a `.gitignore` file.

2. Create a `README.md` file in the project's root directory with instructions on how to build and use the application. This file will also provide an overview of the tool, its features, and any relevant documentation.

## Building

You can create a bash script to automatically set up the files and directories for the iSee Rust application. Save the following script as setup_iSee.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a new Rust project
cargo new iSee
cd iSee

# Add dependencies to Cargo.toml
cat <<EOT >> Cargo.toml
tesseract-rs = "0.9.0"
leptonica-sys = "0.3.0"
walkdir = "2.3.2"
EOT

# Create a README.md file
cat <<EOT >> README.md
# iSee

iSee is an OCR productivity tool that processes images of text and outputs the transcriptions to a text file.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo installed
- Tesseract and Leptonica libraries installed

## Building

To build the iSee tool, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
cargo build --release
\`\`\`

This will create an optimized executable in the \`target/release\` directory.

## Usage

To use the iSee tool, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
./target/release/iSee "path/to/your/image/folder" "output_file.txt"
\`\`\`

Replace \`path/to/your/image/folder\` with the path to the folder containing the images you want to process, and \`output_file.txt\` with the desired output file name.

The tool will prompt you to confirm whether you want to proceed with the OCR process. If you type "y" and press Enter, the process will begin, and the output will be saved to the specified file.

# Initialize a Git repository and commit changes
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

To run the script, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `setup_iSee.sh` file, and execute the following command:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup_iSee.sh
```

This script will create the iSee Rust application with the appropriate directory structure, add the necessary dependencies to `Cargo.toml`, and create a `README.md` file. It will also initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit.
